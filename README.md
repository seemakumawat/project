# EduFace AI - Face Recognition Attendance System

A comprehensive face recognition-based attendance system designed for educational institutions. This system uses advanced machine learning algorithms (MTCNN and FaceNet) to automatically detect and recognize students' faces for attendance tracking.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Face Detection**: Uses MTCNN (Multi-task CNN) for accurate face detection
- **Face Recognition**: Implements FaceNet algorithm for face recognition
- **Automatic Attendance**: Records attendance automatically when faces are recognized
- **Multi-face Recognition**: Can recognize multiple students in a single image
- **Real-time Processing**: Supports both camera capture and image upload

### System Components
1. **Student Management**: Add and manage student information
2. **Training System**: Capture and train face recognition models
3. **Attendance System**: Process images and record attendance
4. **Student Profiles**: Quick student identification and profile viewing
5. **Reports & Analytics**: System statistics and attendance reports

### Technical Features
- **Database Integration**: SQLite database for student and attendance data
- **CSV Export**: Export attendance records to CSV format
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for administrators
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Professional GUI**: Modern, educational-themed user interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam (optional, for camera capture)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

- View detailed student profile information
- Quick search by student ID

## System Architecture

### Machine Learning Components
- **MTCNN**: Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks for face detection
- **FaceNet**: Deep learning model for face recognition and embedding generation
- **SVM Classifier**: Support Vector Machine for final face classification

### Database Schema
- **Students Table**: Student information (ID, name, email, CGPA, advisor, address)
- **Attendance Table**: Attendance records (student_id, course, date, time, status)

```

## Configuration

### Training Parameters
- **Images per student**: 20-30 recommended
- **Image size**: 160x160 pixels (automatically resized)
- **Confidence threshold**: 70% for recognition
- **Detection threshold**: 90% for face detection

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 1GB free space for training data
- **Camera**: Any USB webcam (optional)
- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**
   - Check if camera is connected and not used by other applications
   - Try different camera index in the code (0, 1, 2, etc.)

2. **Low recognition accuracy**
   - Ensure good lighting conditions during training
   - Capture more training images (30+ per student)
   - Retrain the system after adding new images

3. **Import errors**
   - Install all required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version (3.7+ required)

4. **Database errors**
   - Check file permissions in the project directory
   - Delete database files to reset (data will be lost)

### Performance Optimization
- Use SSD storage for better performance
- Ensure adequate RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Close unnecessary applications during training
- Use good quality images for training

## Technical Details

### Face Recognition Pipeline
1. **Image Input**: Camera capture or file upload
2. **Face Detection**: MTCNN detects faces in the image
3. **Face Preprocessing**: Resize and normalize detected faces
4. **Feature Extraction**: Generate face embeddings using FaceNet
5. **Classification**: SVM classifier identifies the person
6. **Attendance Recording**: Store results in database

### Accuracy Metrics
